				<p>Hi, my name is Marc and  my journey into coding started January 30th, 2017 at 6:30pm. I majored in biology and environmental studeis at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin and currently work in a mouse histology lab at Northwestern University. 
				<br><br>
				My goal is to become effective enough at coding that I can affect real change towards bettering society's stewardship of the natural environment. 
				<br>
				For now, I am happy gaining the experience that I will need to carry this out and look forward to working with the rest of the classroom.
